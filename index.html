        <h2>Olare Motorogi Conservancy</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
          <b>Olare Motorogi Conservancy</b> is situated along the northern edge of Masai Mara National Reserve. Olare Motorogi Conservancy is a culmination of the merging of two sub-conservancies i.e., Olare Orok and Motorogi. The Olare Motorogi Conservancy was established in May of 2006. To create the conservancy, 277 Maasai landowners collectively set aside a total of 35,000 acres of their land. The Olare Motorogi Conservancy includes valuable habitats, such as the lower sections of the Olare Orok River and Ntiakitiak River valleys, as well as its riverine forest. 
          Another prominent natural feature in the conservancy is Ntiakitiak Gorge and the associated escarpment that measures twelve kilometers in length. An ecologically-significant woodlands are located just below the escarpment. By setting aside land for the Olare Motorogi, the landowners have created an important buffer zone that includes migration corridors for many of Masai Mara fauna. The success of the Olare Motorogi Conservancy serves as a template for other later conservancies adjoining <b>Masai Mara National Reserve</b>. Wildlife populations have steadily increased as has the diversity of animals in the conservancy. Olare Motorogi Conservancy guests find a wonderful balance of predators and herbivores, including highly endangered species, such as African wild dogs and rhinos. In following best practices of low-density experiences at Olare Motorogi, the Olare Motorogi Conservancy has35 rooms (1 room per over 650 acres) in between six-member accommodations i.e., Mara Plains Camp, Mahali Mzuri, Kicheche Bush Camp, Porini Lion Camp, Olare Mara Kempinski. Both conservancy fee and part benight revenue are fed into the safari operations of the conservancy, as well as local community projects that benefit the Maasai landowners and its families.

        <h2>Wildlife in Olare Motorogi </h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
          Although most safari travelers choose to visit the Masai Mara during the high traffic months July through October, this conservancy offers its visitors magnificent game-viewing all year round. The hills are the year-round home to a remarkably diverse population of giraffes, wildebeests, warthogs and zebras. Naturally having these herbivores around in large numbers also makes the area more than a little attractive to predators. The conservancy is immensely popular among lions, hyenas, jackals, cheetahs, leopards and other meat eaters. The ‘luggas’ (small seasonal streams) that run through the conservancy’s hills are lined by beautiful green strips of forest. The vegetation attracts a variety of leaf-eaters such as elephants, baboons, buffaloes and hippos. During the great migration you’ll see quite a bit of action in the conservancy caused by the migrating herds passing through the wildlife corridors. However, you may have to take a drive to the south towards the Mara Confluence to see the more massive and dramatic river crossings  
        </p>
          <h2>Activities in Olare Motorogi</h2>
           <p style="text-align:justify;">
            So, what makes staying at a Masai Mara conservancy so worthwhile? Well obviously, the high concentration of wildlife to be seen makes a conservancy quite interesting to include in your itinerary. A few additional benefits of staying at a conservancy is being able to go on off-road safaris, the ability to go on guided nature walks, the joy of enjoying a bush meal and the ability to go on game drive at night. All of this takes place against a backdrop of emerald-hued riverine forests that run like a ribbon along the lower valleys of the Olare Olak and Ntiakitiak Rivers, the impressive Ntiakitiak Gorge and a beautiful twelve kilometre long escarpment. The acacia woodlands beneath the escarpment are home to all species of creatures, big and small. Many of the safari activities mentioned above aren’t possible within the confines of the actual Masai Mara National Reserve. If you value cultural interaction and would like to get to know the Masai people, you’ll have ample opportunity to do so while staying at the conservancy. Since the Maasai are stakeholders in the conservancy, they are very welcoming to those who decide to stay there.

        <h2>Olare Motorogi Game </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            The eco-friendly <b>Maison Royale Camp</b> offers a unique opportunity to take guided walks with Maasai Warriors and experience day and night safari game drives within the Olare Motorogi Conservancy – a pristine and exclusive 33000-acre wilderness set aside for wildlife conservation and low-impact tourism. The <b>Maison Royale Camp</b> is located in a stunning setting on the banks of the seasonal River within the Olare Motorogi Conservancy. This large area borders the Maasai Mara National Reserve and is home to an abundance of animals including the Mara’s renowned Big Cats. There is unsurpassed game-viewing within the conservancy due to its unspoiled natural state and the <b>Maison Royale Camp</b> – with just nine tents and one family unit – ensures guests have a genuine “away from it all” experience deep in the African bush. The high-quality, spacious tents are tastefully furnished and each has solar-powered lighting, ensuite facilities (with hot shower and flush toilet) and a private veranda. <b>Maison Royale Camp</b> is fully-inclusive of meals, drinks (vodka, gin & tonics, wine, beer, sodas and mineral water) and all activities, including day and night game drives, sundowners and escorted walks.  A group <b>Masai Mara safari</b> or scheduled <b>Masai Mara safaris</b> are fine when the herds are on the mara river plains because the migration route only goes as far as the central Masai Mara, A private <b>safari to Masai Mara</b> gives a personal exclusive experience while group <b>safaris to Masai Mara</b> offers you the opportunity to share your experience with other travelers. Also, a private <b>safari in Masai Mara</b> is more flexible and may cater to individual needs while group <b>safaris in Masai Mara</b> are pre-planned and caters according to the majority of the group.

         <p style="text-align:justify;">
Game drives can take place in the morning, afternoon, evening or at night. So please let us know your preference. Alternatively, you can book a dedicated game drive (up to six guests in a vehicle). A game drive through the Olare Motorogi Conservancy is a voyage of discovery that promises to transport you into a whole new realm. This is your chance to observe creatures great and small against the backdrop of a pristine wilderness. Often awe-inspiring, always enchanting, a game drive allows you to be part of the great wilderness landscape: to breath it: to smell it: to live it. Managed in cooperation with its ancient guardians, the Maasai, this is a realm where you will rarely see another safari vehicle, where the savannah is yours, and where you will often find yourselves as the only spectators to such events as lions at play, wallowing hippos, wandering elephants, browsing giraffes and careering herds of zebra. During the season, you can also witness one of the world’s most stunning natural events: the annual migration of over one million wildebeest and their attendant wildlife cast. Our custom-built six-person safari vehicles offer comfort, panoramic viewing, dedicated safari guides, refreshments on-board (soft drinks and local beer) and radio-links for fast location of game. Traditionally, game-drives take place early morning (you are woken with tea and arrive back in time for breakfast) or late afternoon/early evening. They can also incorporate picnic breakfasts or lunches and evening sundowners in the bush. We also offer night game-drives: which promise you nocturnal drama indeed. What you can see: this unique ecosystem hosts over 95 species of mammals. Highlights include: elephant, buffalo, hippo, Masai giraffe, topi, Coke's hartebeest, Grant's and Thomson's gazelle, zebra, impala, Kirk's dik-dik, bushbuck, waterbuck, red duiker, baboon, vervet monkey, blue monkey, red-tailed monkey, nocturnal bush baby, and tree hyrax. Predators include lion, cheetah, leopard and hyena. Birds: 550 recorded species, 5 of which are globally threatened.        </p>
